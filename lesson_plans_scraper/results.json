In this lesson, students will explore these questions and test the pH of their own sample of water.\n\nFirst, the students will watch a video about water quality and follow along by answering the questions on the video reflection sheet. Then, the teacher will lecture using the powerpoint provided for more background information on the subject matter. The teacher will then pass out the test tubes and assign the students to take a sample of drinking water around their house to be brought in the following day. This will conclude the first day. The second day is a lab and review day. The students will interact with lab materials and use the scientific method in order to determine the pH of different drinking water samples. They will then use data analysis to compare their results with other students to reach a conclusion. They will then play a game to review the information learned, and write a reflective essay on the topics discussed. \n",
