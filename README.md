# SciREN-Net

A website to connect researchers, teachers, and students looking for course material.

This site was delevoped for CS 495 at the University of Alabama in Spring of 2023.

## What is SciREN

Our mission is to improve the accessibility of course material for instructors while helping researchers expose their lesson plans. Sciren-net hosts user interactions with basic profiles for teachers and researchers containing information relating to their academic work. We're helping migrate the existing SciREN platform to a modern web application to improve accessibility for the existing SciREN users.

## Existing Platforms

We encourage you to check out the existing SciREN groups below, especially if you're looking for new teaching material.
